Notes on reproducing examples
-----------------------------

All plots in the plot gallery have a set of implicit imports
and setup code that runs before any given code examples:

.. code-block:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import scipy
   import seaborn as sns
   from statannotations.Annotator import Annotator
   from matplotlib import ticker as mticker

   sns.set_theme(style="ticks")

If you are reproducing the code on your own, make sure that these lines have been run!


All example data needed is available as a zip file: `plot_gallery_data.zip <../_static/files/plot_gallery_data.zip>`__.
