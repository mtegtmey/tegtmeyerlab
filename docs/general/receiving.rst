==================
Receiving packages
==================

Packages are usually delivered to the atrium (lab entrance near 66-219), or occasionally to the lab office. When a package arrives, do all of the following:

1. Find the packing slip or open the package to determine the contents of the item.

 .. important:: It is important to immediately determine whether the item is temperature sensitive, so that it can be properly stored. Thus, receive all packages promptly!

2. If you know where the item is stored, put it away properly.
3. If you don't know where the item is stored, determine whether the item is temperature sensitive.

   - **If the package is temperature-sensitive, open the package immediately** and store it in an appropriate fridge/freezer:

     ============== ========= ========================
      Temperature     Type      Location
     ============== ========= ========================
      4ºC           Cloning    Kristoff (deli fridge)
      4ºC           TC         Oaken
      -20ºC         Cloning    Anna
      -20ºC         TC         Olaf, top shelf
      -80ºC         Cloning    Elsa, bottom shelf
      -80ºC         TC         Nokk, top shelf
     ============== ========= ========================

   - For items that are not temperature sensitive, leave the package on the recipient's lab bench.

4. If the item appears urgent (e.g., temperature-sensitive items) or is not a common lab item, message the recipient that you received the package and indicate where you put the item.
5. Place the packing slip in the box in the atrium near 66-219. This helps us diligently track received items for financial record-keeping and alerts us to inquire about missing packages.
6. Mark the item as received on Quartzy. To do so, navigate to the \'Ordered\' section under the \'Requests\' tab and click the \'Mark Received\' button.
