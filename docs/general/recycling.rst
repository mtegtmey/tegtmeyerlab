Recycling
==========

MIT has several recycling programs for various lab plastics, packaging, and so on. The up to date
`Facilities information site <https://web.mit.edu/recycling>`_ should be checked for details.

Currently, we recycle the following items in the following ways:

- **Cardboard**: break down the box and place it in/near a blue recycling bin, especially the one in the atrium.
- **Hard plastics #1, #2, #5**: place in a blue recycling bin.
- **Pipette tip boxes and conical racks**: place in the specific pipette tip/rack collection box. We schedule pickups through `this Quickbase link <https://mit.quickbase.com/db/bq2rx8ncp?a=nwr>`_. This box goes to a local startup who recycles these.
- **Styrofoam**: Leave clean coolers/boxes/lids made of Styrofoam **next to** a blue recycling bin. Bag Styrofoam into clear plastic bags for pickup.
- **Film plastic**: Collect film plastics (e.g., palette wrap, the plastic around filter tips) *into the labeled cardboard box in main TC, not into the standard blue recycling bins*. The blue recycling bins go to the single-stream recycling provider, and films can gum up those machines. We can move our film to the plastic bag recycling in the basement room (66-017).

We do not recycle the following:

- Anything bio- or chemically-contaminated
- Gloves, even if they are clean.
