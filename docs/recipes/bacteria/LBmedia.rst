LB selection plates
========================


1. Dissolve 32 g of LB agar powder in 800 mL of sterile/ELGA water.  
2. Autoclave on 20 min liquid cycle at 121C.
3. Wait for the solution to cool to about 45-50 C by letting it sit on a bench (room temperature).

.. tip::
  If you can keep touching it with bare hands, that indicates the temperature of the LB is around 45-50C and it's time to add antibiotics.

4. Add 800 uL of 1000x antibiotics to the autoclaved LB agar-water solution. 
5. Dissolve the antibiotics by stirring with a stir bar. 
6. Before pouring, ensure no agar has solidified in the bottle (as a result of uneven cooling). If this happens, shake manually to re-melt the agar.
7. Pour 20-25ml of the antibiotic-containing LB to petri dishes using a pipette.
  
.. tip::
  Alternatively, you can pour LB by hand if you experience solidification when pipetting.

9. Incubate the poured plates at RT until the LB agar solidifies (normally takes about 30-45min).
   
10. After plates solidify, place plates back in the sleeve bag and store at 4C.
