1. Dissolve 8 tablets of PBS tablets into 2L of ELGA water in a large beaker (1 tablet/250mL) on a stir plate.
2. Cover the beaker with aluminum foil to prevent dust settling
3. After the solids are completely dissolved, adjust the pH of the solution to 7.4 by adding NaOH or HCl dropwise.
4. Keep stirring the PBS while adjusting the pH and keep measuring the pH until it completely equilibrates.
5. Transfer pH-adjusted PBS into 500mL or 1L bottles, label and mark with autoclave tape, and autoclave in liquid cycle.

=============
1. Dissolve 0.5 g gelatin (Type A, from porcine skin) (Sigma G1890) into 500uL ELGA water in an autoclavable glass bottle. Scale volume as needed.
