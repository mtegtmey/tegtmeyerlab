Glycerol Stocking 
====================

After successfully sequencing a bacterial plasmid, we must stock it for storage. 

1. Add the plasmid to the database in Quartzy. See instructions on :doc:`this page <../../general/plasmid_database>`. 

.. important:: 
    Add plasmids to the database before stocking! That way, you don't run into issues with overlapping numbering if someone else
    is also stocking around the same time.

2. Culture desired 4 mL of bacteria clone with the plasmid in LB Broth with the correct resistance antibiotic (overnight). 
3. Add 2 mL of 60% glycerol to the 4 mL of culture. Mix well. 
4. Aliquot 2 mL of the resulting mixture to three cryovials. 
5. Label each cryovial with pKG#, date, initials, and description of the construct. Labels can be printed using the LabBot app on slack "Print Labels". (If it does not show up begin to type "/labels" to find it.) You must be connected to MIT Wifi for this app to work.
6. Put cyrovials in -80 C. Put one cryovial per box.
