Snap-tag Labeling
=====================================

Cell expressing the Snap protein or a Snap-tagged fusion protein can be labeled live, without fixation using Snap ligands ordered from NEB. 
This protocol for labeling of live cells with Snap ligand is also found on `the NEB website <https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/cellular-labeling-s9105>`_.

.. note::
    Resuspended Snap-ligand is kept frozen in the -20°C freezer and has been used after several freeze/thaw cycles with no apparent detriment.  

.. note:: 
    The NEB website recommends the above stock concentrations as 200x. Greater dilutions can been used and labeling is still sufficient. AMB has used 400x dilution (2.5 µL dye / mL media ) to label and had detectable signal.
    Greater dilutions may also reduce the amount of background staining.

Other materials needed:
________________________  
- DMEM + 10% FBS
- Adherent cells to stain

Add Snap ligand to cells
--------------------------------------------
1. Working in a BSC hood, dilute resuspended Snap ligand in an FBS containing medium 1:200 to making the Snap-working solution. Greater dilutions can be used for high-abundance proteins. 
2. Aspirate media from adherent cells and replace media with the Snap-working solution. 

    - For the Snap staining a "half" well volume may be used (e.g. 1 mL per well of 6-well plate, 0.5 mL in a 12-well, etc.)
3. Incubate the cells in Snap-working solution in the incubator (37°C) for 30 minutes. 

Wash and destain ligand
--------------------------
4. After 30 minutes, remove the Snap-working solution and wash 3 times with FBS containing medium.
5. On the third wash, leave the media on the cells and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes to allow unreacted ligand to diffuse out. 
6. Remove final wash media and proceed to downstream application (imaging, flow, etc.)

.. note::
  If you got high background signal, you can dilute resuspended Snap ligand in an FBS containing medium 1:500-1:1000
