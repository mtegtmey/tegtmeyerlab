His-tag protein purification
=============================

.. warning::

  This protocol was attempted for Tn5 purification. This was unsuccessful,
  though possibly not because of this protocol.

Required solutions
-------------------
* **Lysis buffer**: You have options! Check page 113 of the QIAexpressionist.
* **10% PEI**: pH to 7.2

.. note::
    Do not use the cOmplete running and elution buffers with normal Ni-NTA His-tag resin!
    They contain chelating agents that will remove the nickel ions! cOmplete His-tag
    resin is resistant to small concentrations of chelating agents.

* **cOmplete running buffer (native)**:

Protocol
--------
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in lysis buffer, on ice. For every gram of cell pellet, use 10 mL lysis buffer.
2. Sonicate the resuspended cells, using 5 cycles of 30-second, medium-amplitude 50% duty-cycle sonication.
3. Spin to clarify the lysate using maximum centrifuge speed (14600 xg) for 30 minutes.
4. If the protein of interest has DNA-binding activity, add 1.2 mL/10mL **10% PEI** dropwise while stirring.
   Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 minutes to remove bound DNA.
5. Fill a column with roughly 1.0 mL resin per gram of cell lysate.

.. note::
    When using affinity columns, the volumes required will be listed as Column Volumes (CVs).
    The amount of resin is the CV. For a gram preparation, this would mean the CV is 1 mL.

5. Equilibrate the column with 3 CVs of running buffer.
6. Flow the clarified cell lysate across the column, collecting the flow-through.
7. Rinse the column with 8 CVs of running buffer, collecting flow-through fractions.
8. Elute with four separate 0.5 CV washes of elution buffer.
9. Run all collected samples on a SDS-page gel to confirm successful purification.
