Keck Microscopy Facility
========================

The `W.M. Keck Microscopy Facility <https://wi.mit.edu/core-facilities/microscopy/equipment-software>`_ at the Whitehead Institute has 
confocal, lightsheet, and widefield microscopes that are available for use. Obtaining access to the facility and training on the 
equipment takes several weeks to schedule, so plan ahead.

1. Fill out a `new user form <https://nematode.wi.mit.edu/kecklendar/intake?newuser=true>`_. The lab's Whitehead Cores Customer Number is 
   ``6289``.
2. Email Tseganesh to authorize you on an associated PO for the lab's Whitehead account.
3. After you submit the new user form, you'll meet with one of the core specialists for an initial consultation. At this meeting, be prepared 
   to share information on cell type, fluorophores, desired microscopes, live/fixed sample, etc.
4. The core specialist will also send you a **list of trainings and paperwork** to complete. Follow the steps they outline. This may include:
   
   - Paperwork to obtain card access
   - Picking up a physical Whitehead ID card
   - Building safety trainings

5. Once you have access to the facility, you can make an appointment for a first training session with a specialist (using your own test
   samples---don't bring any precious experiments, though!).
6. The next time you book a session, it must be when one of the core staff is present in case you have questions. Check with the core staff 
   about their hours and availability.
7. After that, you can book whenever you want using the online calendar system (the 
   `"Kecklendar" <https://wi.mit.edu/core-facilities/microscopy/kecklendar>`_).
