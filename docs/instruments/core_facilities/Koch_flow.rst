    TO DO


Sony MA-900
============
The Sony MA900 cell sorter has a `SOP <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1toqMY_qnDy0_YDkcEr2ktDJWcteKe0Pj42_scukqT5s/edit>`__ that you can follow for startup and shutdown.

Startup
--------
If you are interested in running this cell sorter over the weekend or outside of normal hours, you should contact the flow core and ask to come in on the morning to see the startup. The Sony is generally very easy to startup once you've seen how to; you mostly follow automated prompts and switch out the sorting chip. However, the auto-alignment and equivilant of the Attune performance test takes around 45 minutes.

Shutdown
---------
Follow the shutdown SOP, with the exception that on step 7 ("Turn off the air compressor and blue switch on the air-line"), do **not** turn off the blue switch on the air-line, and turn off the air compressor by turning off the power strip that is below you to the left, when sitting at the computer. **Do not** turn off the air compressor by turning off the switch on the back of it.
