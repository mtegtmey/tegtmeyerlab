User-replaceable parts
======================

Main syringe
------------
See page 16 in the `Attune maintenance guide <../../_static/files/attune_maintenance_guide.pdf>`__ for full details.

As detailed in :doc:`startup_shutdown`, before every run the syringe should be examined for a build-up of salt.
Salt buildup occurs when micro-clogs occur in the sample loop. Due to the back-pressure applied to the syringe,
small drops of liquid can be forced around the syringe. These drops get pushed to the bottom of the syringe travel,
where they dry and form a salt ring.

When a salt ring forms, the syringe should be replaced.

1. Shut down the Attune.
2. Unscrew the bottom thumb-screw, to release the ball of the syringe.
3. Carefully remove the ball from the piston, then rotate the syringe counter-clockwise to unscrew it.
4. Insert the ball of the new syringe into the bottom mechanism.
5. Align the syringe with the syringe port, rotate clockwise until the syringe bottoms out on the valve.

.. warning::

    Do not apply excessive force; if the syringe does not easily screw in with light finger-only force,
    you may be cross-threading the syringe!

6. After bottoming out (e.g. when you first feel resistance), screw **only an additional quarter of a turn!**
7. Tighten the thumbscrew to secure the syringe ball.
8. After replacement, run 3 startup procedures, 2 debubble procedures, and 2 rinse procedures before use!


Sample Injection Probe (SIP)
----------------------------
See page 18 in the `Attune maintenance guide <../../_static/files/attune_maintenance_guide.pdf>`__ for full details.

If too much force is applied, the tube SIP may be bent. If the bend is minor, it can be carefully bent back.
If the bend is severe, order a new SIP.

1. Unscrew the old SIP tube.
2. Move the plastic fitting to the new SIP tube.
3. Hand tighten the new SIP until the fitting audibly clicks.
4. Run 3 startup procedures, 2 debubble procedures, and 2 rinse procedures before use.


Focusing fluid filters
----------------------
See page 15 in the `Attune maintenance guide <../../_static/files/attune_maintenance_guide.pdf>`__ for full details.

.. note::

    The focusing fluid filters must be replaced after a system decontamination.

1. Remove all internal fluid bottles from the Attune.
2. Place Kimwipes or paper towels beneath the focusing fluid filters to catch any drips.
3. Undo the velcro securing the focusing fluid filters to the Attune.
4. Gently pull the filter slightly out to an angle from the machine.
5. Unscrew the top tubing by rotating it counter-clockwise.
6. Holding the filter between your fingers, unscrew the bottom fitting by rotating it counter-clockwise.
7. Unscrew both the black section of the top female-to-male luerlock adapter and the bottom male-to-female
   luerlock adapter.

.. warning::

    The new filters do not contain the luerlock adapters! If you throw them away/lose them, you will have to
    obtain replacements!

8. Orient the new filter with the arrow pointing downward. Screw the luerlock adapters in.
9. Screw in the bottom part of the filter into the amber threaded adapter at the bottom.
10. Using a syringe, flush 10 mL of focusing fluid into the top of the filter. Do not apply any backpressure to the system!
11. Carefully screw in the top luerlock adapter into the top of the tubing until a click is felt.
12. Run 3 startup procedures, 2 debubble procedures, and 2 rinse procedures while observing for leaks.
