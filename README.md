# Tegtmeyer Lab protocols

## Locally building the protocols.

### Installation
This documentation is build with Sphinx. To build locally, you will need to install Python 3.

It is recommended that you use a **virtual environment** for repeatability purposes. First, create a virtual environment
(called `env` by default, but can be named other things):

```
python -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment on Linux/MacOS/[any POSIX system](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#dot):
```
. env/bin/activate
```

if using `bash` or `zsh` or other modern shells, you can use the `source` alias for `.`:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

or with Powershell on Windows:
```
env\Scripts\activate
```

From here, you can install the frozen package versions inside the virtual enviroment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You're ready to go!

If you are interested, the packages for manual installation are:
```
pip install -U sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx-last-updated-by-git
```

### Building

The HTML and PDF documentation can be build with:
```
python build.py --latex
```

To skip PDF building (for example, if you don't have a local LaTeX install),
run:
```
python build.py
```

Build output is in the folder `output`. The HTML version can be loaded by clicking on `output\html\index.html`.

If you run into strange Sphinx errors upon building, the output directory may have been corrupted. In this case, close any
programs (e.g. Windows Explorer, Adobe Acrobat) accessing the built documentation and run:
```
python build.py --force-rebuild
```

This command will first remove the `output` directory before continuing.

## Automatic protocol builds

This documentation is also automatically build and published to on every push.

## Contributing
Protocol files are written in the [reStructuredText format](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html), a relatively lightweight markup language. See the linked primer for details on how to make tables, link images, or link to other protocols. All protocols are located in the `docs` folder.

This project has one custom directive: an estimated time directive. To use it, simply write:
```
.. time:: 35 billion years

```
The empty line after the directive is important! Remember that reStructuredText directives need that empty line to distinguish them from other text.

### Adding a new protocol
When adding a new protocol, ensure that it has a title so it shows up properly in the table of contents! The title is the first piece of text surrounded by equal signs. An example protocol:
```
=================
The best protocol
=================

.. time:: 3 hours

Protocol
========
  1. Prep the cool science.
  2. Do the cool science.
  3. Clean up the cool science.

.. note::
  1. Make sure to read this before starting!
```

### Adding a new subsection
If you want to add additional structure to the protocols, the easiest way to do it is to add a new subfolder. Inside that folder, add a file `index.rst` with the following:
```
=================
Subsection name
=================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :glob:
   
   *
```
This will auto-include all other `*.rst` files present in the same directory. If you are doing further nesting, you may want to include the glob `*/index` to include all subdirectories as well. An example of this is in [docs/protocols/index.rst](docs/protocols/index.rst).
